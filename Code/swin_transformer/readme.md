Certainly! Let me explain the code in the model.py file in a more understandable way:


The model.py file contains the implementation of the Swin Transformer model using TensorFlow and Keras. Here's a breakdown of the code:


The code starts by importing necessary libraries such as NumPy and TensorFlow.

It defines a dictionary called CFGS that contains different configurations for the Swin Transformer model, specifying parameters like input size, window size, embedding dimension, depths, and number of heads for different model variants.

The Mlp class is defined, which represents a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) block used in the Swin Transformer. It consists of two dense layers with GELU activation and dropout.

The window_partition and window_reverse functions are utility functions used for partitioning the input features into windows and reversing the process.

The WindowAttention class implements the window-based self-attention mechanism. It computes the attention scores and values within each window.

The drop_path function is a helper function for stochastic depth, which randomly drops out layers during training to improve regularization.

The DropPath class is a wrapper around the drop_path function, allowing it to be used as a layer in the model.

The SwinTransformerBlock class represents a single Swin Transformer block. It consists of a window-based multi-head self-attention layer followed by an MLP block. It also includes layer normalization and residual connections.

The PatchMerging class is responsible for merging patches and reducing the spatial dimensions of the features.

The BasicLayer class represents a basic layer in the Swin Transformer, which consists of multiple Swin Transformer blocks and an optional patch merging layer.

The PatchEmbed class is used to split the input image into patches and embed them into a lower-dimensional space.

The SwinTransformerModel class is the main model class that combines all the components to create the Swin Transformer architecture. It takes various parameters such as input size, patch size, number of classes, depths, number of heads, etc., and builds the model accordingly.

The SwinTransformer function is a wrapper that creates an instance of the SwinTransformerModel with specified configurations. It also handles loading pretrained weights if requested.


The delete_image.py file contains a script to delete image files from specific directories. It iterates over the files in the directories /home/users/juhaif/dataset/data/0, /home/users/juhaif/dataset/data/1, and /home/users/juhaif/dataset/data/2, and removes files beyond the first 1000 files in each directory.


The train.py file contains the code for training the Swin Transformer model on an image classification task. It sets up the necessary libraries, configurations, and command-line arguments. It loads the training, validation, and test datasets using ImageDataGenerator, creates an instance of the Swin Transformer model, compiles the model with categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer with a learning rate schedule, and trains the model using the fit_generator method. After training, it saves the trained model and plots the training and validation accuracy and loss curves using Matplotlib.
